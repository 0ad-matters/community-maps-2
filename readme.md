Checked all forum threads updated from 2016 onwards.

If you are one of the authors and want your map removed from this mod, or want
something to be changed either in the map or in the way credit is given,
please open an issue on this GitHub repo. If you have a custom map and would
like it included here, you may submit it as a [pull
request](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (if you're not a GitHub
user, you may have someone submit the map on your behalf).

## Installing

You can install the pyromod file from the [releases
section](https://github.com/0ad-matters/community-maps-2/releases) or
the zip file from [0ad.mod.io](https://0ad.mod.io/community-maps-2).
Periodically, the latest release will be available by downloading
directly from the 0ad mod downloader (It's usually best to check there
first). You can confirm the latest release by looking at the top of the
release section on the GitHub repo.

Note: If you use "Download Zip" from the repo home page, the zip file
will not be installable by 0ad and you'll receive an error.
